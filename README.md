## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Aryan Jung Thapa here.

Welcome to the repo.

Here you can find the projects me and my team had worked on.

**BooksOnline** : 
My team and I developed this project to provide a convenient platform for users to order books online, saving them time while still enjoying their favorite reads. Additionally, users have the option to read books digitally if they prefer. This project was created as part of our second-semester coursework and is designed to be simple and user-friendly, ensuring accessibility for all readers.

**TouristDestination** : 
My team and I developed this system to assist tourists and travelers in Nepal by recommending destinations based on their preferences. Users can enter the name of a place, and the system suggests similar locations, enhancing their travel experience. Additionally, they have the option to customize recommendations by adding tags or selecting categories that align with their interests. This project aims to provide a personalized and efficient way for travelers to explore Nepal.
